# Care Circle

Have you ever wondered how you can help a loved one who has recently had undergone a surgery, given birth, or is mourning a loss? 

Care Circle provides a way to communicate to your loved ones about ways that they can support you or someone else during times of need. It reduces the mental load for the user to remember who has offered to help you and with what. Members of the user's circle can volunteer for tasks without needing to contact the user directly.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies for Care Circle.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Users can create an account for themselves or someone else. To get started, add tasks or items that you could use a hand with. Invite friends/family to your circle and they will be able to view and sign up for tasks! 

## Future Improvements
- Calendar view of upcoming tasks
- Allow guests to create their own account and manage tasks they have signed up for
- Email reminders for upcoming tasks
- Send notes of gratitude
